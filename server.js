She was able to make her money by becoming a successful model, using her powers to shape her body to the ultimate figure. Crawford's stance on the mutant question is unknown, but it would appear that she is more concerned with balancing her conflicting supermodel/superhero careers than with the global conflict between humans and mutants.",

One night Dracula searched through the local Swiss town, but could find noone to feast upon, so he drank Bessies blood. The next morning Hans discovered Bessies lifeless body and buried her. Three nights after she was buried she rose from her grave and swore vengeance on Dracula and his kind. Three hundred years later Bessie found herself in Cleveland, Ohio where she encountered Howard the Duck who she confused with Dracula and attacked him. Despite Bessies powers Howard managed to gain the upper hand during the battle when Bessie became stuck in a local store. Desperately Howard found a wooden stake and a mallet and drove the stake through Bessies heart, killing her.",

It appears that Doop has recently returned to Earth from outer space, but it is unknown whether this creature, which Polaris identified as Daap, is a different being altogether or if Polaris simply misheard the complex series of clucks and barks that constitute the alien language as Daap instead of Doop.

However, when the team discovered that Leather Boy didn't have any powers, they asked him to leave. Nearly five years later,[3] a mad Scarlet Witch destroyed the Avengers, leaving the G.L.A. as the only Avengers. To bluster their roster, Flatman and Doorman launched a recruiting drive. Although they spoke to several heroes, they were only able to recruit Squirrel Girl and her partner Monkey Joe.[4] Seeing the news reports about Squirrel Girl joining the G.L.A., Leather Boy became furious that he was not asked to rejoin the team. In a rage, Leather Boy broke into the G.L.A.'s headquarters and murdered both Mr. Immortal and Monkey Joe. During a Halloween party costume contest M.C.'d by Squirrel Girl, Leather Boy, still thirsty for revenge, tried to kill Squirrel Girl's new partner Tippy-Toe. Fortunately, Deadpool was also in attendance and saved Tippy. Deadpool then left Leather Boy tied up in a tree to be attacked by squirrels.",

She subsequently saved this squirrel from being chased by a dog, and they became friends. The squirrel, who identified himself as Monkey Joe, encouraged Doreen to use her abilities to help people. Ever since then, Doreen began to fantasize about becoming a superhero, and came up with the alias of the 'Unbeatable Squirrel Girl'.",

Howard was born the eldest son of Dave and Dottie, but beyond enjoying his rocking horse on Christmas as a baby, he disappointed them in every other way. He couldn‚Äôt hold down any job, be it serious or frivolous, and couldn‚Äôt fit in to any group.

Not only were they dysfunctional, his mother and father were alcoholics who turned young Billy Bob out into the streets not far from the trailer park where they lived. Sleazy? Sure. Deceitful? Of course. Did it work? Like a charm.  Phat didn't necessarily live up to the high-flying, high-profile lifestyle of the typical X-Statix superhero.
